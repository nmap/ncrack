  [Evangelos Deirmetzoglou - GSoC 2017]

o Added new modules: Cassandra and IMAP
  [Panagiotis Ilias / Barrend]

o Improved WinRM module to support NTLM authentication
  [Evangelos Deirmetzoglou for Google Summer of Code 2017]

o Implemented 'cr' (connection retries) option (caps number of consecutive
  connection attempts until host/service is removed from list)
  [Evangelos Deirmetzoglou - GSoC 2017]

o Added 'db' and 'domain' module options for protocols that need a specific
  database (e.g. MongoDB) or domain (e.g. WinRM)

o Updated Ncrack to use latest Nsock & Nbase versions. 

o Added --stealthy-linear timing option for stealthier cracking sessions


Ncrack 0.5 [2016-03-17]

o Added 4 new modules: Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SIP. Thanks to edeirme for
  implementing the Redis, PostgreSQL and MySQL modules.

o Added --pairwise option for special username/password iteration.

o Added --proxy option and proxy support implementation. Many thanks
  to Andrew Farabee (https://github.com/andrewfarabee/) for implementing
  it.

o Updated the Ncrack openssh library, now based on the OpenSSH 7.1
  codebase and updated the SSH module to support all the latest ciphers.


Ncrack 0.4ALPHA [2011-04-23]

o Added the VNC module to Ncrack's arsenal. Thanks to rhh of rycon.hu for
  implementing the module and discussing about it for further improvement.

o Wrote the Ncrack Developer's Guide, which is meant to give an overall
  insight into Ncrack's architecture and help programmers develop their own
  modules (http://nmap.org/ncrack/devguide.html)

o Fixed critical bug in RDP module, which caused Ncrack to fail cracking
  some Windows 2003 server versions.

o Added a mechanism (MODULE_ERR), which modules can use to report to the
  Ncrack engine that the authentication wasn't completed due to an
  application error. For instance, the VNC server often notifies the client
  that there are "too many authentication failures" and Ncrack can then
  close the running connections and wait some time until the above wears
  off.  

o Ncrack can now print the nsock EID (unique connection ID) in debugging
  messages. This will greatly help us track problems, since error messages
  will be matched to certain connections.


Ncrack 0.3ALPHA [2010-09-07]

o Ncrack can now crack the Remote Desktop Protocol on all Windows versions from
  XP and above, with the introduction of the RDP module. Users are well advised
  to read http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/450 for cracking Windows XP
  machines since they can't handle many concurrent RDP connections.

o Implemented the SMB module which can crack Microsoft's SMB/CIFS services as
  well as UNIX Samba servers.

o Introduced the '-f' option, which forces Ncrack to quit cracking a 
  service after it finds one credential for it. Specifying the option twice
  like '-f -f' will cause Ncrack to completely quit after any credential is
  found on any service.

o Added support for blank-password testing. Ncrack will now test a blank 
  entry whenever it sees an empty line in any of the wordlists. The same
  behaviour applies for passing the options --user '' or --pass ''.

o Improved the Ncrack scorpion logo with an updated SVG version (see
  the top of http://nmap.org/ncrack/)


Ncrack 0.2ALPHA [2010-06-12]

o Ncrack now interactively prints out discovered credentials whenever
  the user presses the 'p' key.  Also, in verbose mode (-v), Ncrack
  now prints new credentials whenever they are discovered.  Basic
  statistics (cracking rate, number of credentials found, but not the
  credentials themselves) can be obtained by pressing enter or another
  key at any time.

o Added the --resume option, which allows users to cancel (usually by
  pressing Ctrl+C) and later restore a cracking session through a file
  with the saved state. The Ncrack restoration file is saved at
  .ncrack/ under the home user's directory for *nix systems and inside
  the user's profile directory (normally under C:\Documents and
  Settings\<user>\.ncrack\) in Windows. The file name format is
  restore.<date>_<time> e.g: restore.2009-11-1_10-10 . The time isn't
  in XX:XX format because Windows doesn't allow colons in filenames.

o Implemented the -iN option which lets Ncrack review Nmap normal
  (-oN) output to find targets.

o Implemented -iX option, which allows Ncrack to obtain targets by
  reading an Nmap XML (-oX) output format file.

o Ncrack's help screen (ncrack -h) now includes practical real-life
  examples as well as a list of protocol cracking modules supported.
  You can also list the supported modules with -V.

o Added experimental pop3(s) support - patch initially made by Bucsay Balazs
  and then modified by Ithilgore.

o Ncrack now shares the Nsock library with Nmap rather than having its
  own fork.  This makes maintenance much easier.  This was
  accomplished by adding a way to compile Nsock without Libpcap (which
  Ncrack doesn't use).

o Fixed a timeout-related error which was due to the way Nsock caches
  its time values to avoid too many gettimeofday() system calls,
  leading to Ncrack thinking that negative time had elapsed in some
  cases.  See the report at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/450.
 
o Fixed bug which caused an endless loop before Ncrack could exit
  properly (reported at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/746).

o Fixed several memory leaks with the help of Valgrind. Also conducted a
  Valgrind test for all modules. A report on a big memory leak was made here:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/1140

o Fixed a problem which lead to the configure script being executed
  twice for each of Ncrack's dependency libraries.  Compilation is
  much faster now.

o Added cleanup function for modules. This is made possible by a
  function pointer (ops_free) in the Connection class, that
  deallocates all internal struct members of misc_info . Since these
  are module-specific data, each module should initialize this
  function upon first invocation.

o Added a snprintf function to Buf class. This is really handy for
  module writers since it allows multiple I/O operations in
  one line.

o Changed the module API Connection class to split the old iobuf
  system into two separate iobufs (one for inbound and one for
  outbound data).

o We now use the same default password list as Nmap, which is based on
  data from many compromised/leaked systems.  We also have included
  several individual files which can be used instead, such as Solar
  Designer's password file from his cracking application John.

o Added the --user and --pass options for command-line user and
  password list specification.

o Reported to Microsoft an issue on Windows (running on Windows rather
  than against it) which was slowing the scans down
  (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/774). Microsoft wasn't able to
  reproduce the problem
  (https://connect.microsoft.com/WNDP/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=479640),
  but it seems that changes made by ESET Nod32 AV on Ithilgore's
  machine may have been the problem.  It works for him if he disables
  Nod32, so users might consider trying that if they experience poor
  performance.

o Fixed a compilation failure which occurred at linking when OpenSSL
  was not available on the system.

o Added this CHANGELOG file to the distribution.

Ncrack 0.01ALPHA [2009-08-10]

o First public release of Ncrack.
